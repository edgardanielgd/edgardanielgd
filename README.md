### 🔵🔵🔵 Who am i?

I'm a Systems and Computing Engineering student at Universidad Nacional de Colombia, enthusiast for autonomous learning and the implementation of new trends in real projects.

### 🟢🟢🟢 What am i doing?

Currently i'm working on personal projects, see https://github.com/UIdealist

As you may expect, i love videogames (even thought i'm not really good), but also i enjoy learning cool stuff, lately Machine learning techniques.

### 🔴🔴🔴 Be more specific...

Well, currently im learning and putting into practice all of the Tensorflow features i've learned so far, i used to go against the system and tried to develop my own neural network frameworks applied to small problems (yes, the classic MNIST problem), you can see my attempts working on that with some friends here: https://github.com/edgardanielgd/Algoritmos-2022-2-2

Also, i'm learning some 3D modelling on Blender, you can see my first steps (with the same friends) here: https://github.com/edgardanielgd/TheRealTowerDefense

I'm planning to create a videogame to learn Unreal Engine as well.

Finally, i'm seeking for challenging projects that require me to work with Rust, which i really loved when i worked with it, see: https://github.com/ArquisoftUNAL/habits_ms

## 🟡🟡🟡 Where can i be helpful?

I love the things that work behind the scenes, that is, backends, machine learning tasks, software infrastructure, cybersecurity, libraries and even electronics. 

However, i would prefer to work on applied machine learning in near future, especially in these Startups that want to apply new ideas or solve new problems

## 🟠🟠🟠 Yes... A fun fact

I use to say that i hate Python but i think most of my projects are made on Python so...
